sentence=Small and simple OLED display library.
paragraph=Designed to use as little FLASH and RAM as possible to run on constrained devices such as the ATtiny series.

Can use I2C, SPI or bit bang I2C on any 2 GPIO pins with the use of my BitBang_I2C library. Supports display sizes of: 128x128, 128x64, 128x32, 64x32, 96x16, 72x40. Now includes scrolling text/gfx and deferred rendering.
